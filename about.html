                 <div class="his">
                <p>“Dumaguete” was coined from the Cebuano word dagit, which means “to snatch”. 
                    The word dumaguet, meaning “to swoop”, was coined because of frequent raids by Moro pirates
                    on this coastal community and its power to attract 
                    and keep visitors,both local and foreign. In 1572, Diego López Povedano indicated the place as Dananguet, 
                    but cartographer Pedro Murillo Velarde in 1734 already used present name of Dumaguete for the settlement.

                <p> In 1890, the island-province of Negros was divided into two politico-military provinces, Occidental and Oriental. 
                    As earlier constituted, in 1898, Dumaguete was included in Negros Oriental. 
                    After the Philippine-American War, on May 1, 1901, a civil government was established by the Americans in the Province of Negros Oriental, 
                    including Dumaguete with the first city-mayor Meliton Larena Y Aureola.
                    When World War II broke out, the city was occupied by the Japanese Imperial Forces on May 26, 1942. It was liberated on April 26, 1945
                    by the combined forces of the United States, Filipino Soldiers and the recognized guerrillas.
                    The establishment of the local military general headquarters and camp base of the Philippine Commonwealth Army 
                    from 1942 to 1946 and the Philippine Constabulary 7th Infantry Regiment from 1944 to 1946 was stationed and located in Dumaguete during World War II.\
                    Three years later on June 15, 1948, Republic Act No. 327, created the City of Dumaguete. 
                    Later, on June 21, 1969, Republic Act No. 5797 was enacted, otherwise known as the Revised Charter of Dumaguete City.

                            <p>During the Spanish colonization of the Philippines,
                               there was a certain area in the island of Negros used as one of the primary stop-over for both local and 
                               foreign travelers going to and from Luzon and  Mindanao.This certain area was later then known as the City of Gentle People
                               due to it’s great hospitality for all it’s visitors who come and go.
                               Dumaguete got its name from the Cebuano term “dagit/dumaguet”, which means to snatch/to swoop. 
                               With the rapid kidnapping of the Moro (pirates), the place was called as such. But despite this ancient incidents, 
                               Dumaguete City is know in a whole new different way.</p>
