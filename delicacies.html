            <div class="delicas">
                <p><i>Sans Rival and Silvanas are some of the famous pastries in Dumaguete.  
                    Tourists who visit the city go home with packs of these pastries, either just for themselves or as requested by tons of their relatives. 
                    <br><br>
                    Despite both having similar ingredients, the difference between the two is that Silvanas is a frozen cookie version of the Sans Rival cakes. 
                    These treats are made of meringue wafers, French buttercream, and cashews, making them loved as preferred chewable snacks not just of the locals, 
                    but also of the city’s visitors from different parts of the world. 
                    <br><br>
                    Given the high demand for Sans Rival and Silvanas, these delicacies are accessible in the center of Dumaguete.
                    One of the top preferred stores that sell these foods is the Sans Rival Cakes and Pastries, located in San Jose Street, Dumaguete City.</i></p>

                <h1><i><b>Bod-bod</b></i></h1>

                <center> <div class="images">

                </div></center>

                <p><i>“Bod-bod” or “Budbod Kabog” is one of the most praised treats by residents and tourists in Dumaguete.
                    It is similar to the famous Filipino kakanin called Suman. What makes this different is its main ingredient which is the millet or kabog, 
                    a cereal crop that has a combination of a sweet and wheaty and nutty taste. <br>
                    <br>
                    This Dumaguete-delicacy can be found just by going to the breakfast shack known as “Painitan” in the City’s Public Market.
                    Budbod Kabog is served wrapped in a banana leaf, and it also comes with an option of chocolate flavor. Due to its hint of sweetness,
                    Bod-bod is also best partnered with coffee or hot chocolate, especially when dipped into the said drinks.</i></p>

                    <p><b><i>Recognizing the importance of authentic delicacies and dishes has an effect that goes as deep as the 
                        preservation of traditions and roots in a specific place or region. For Dumaguete and the province it’s located in, 
                        the foods they offer greatly reflect the lifestyle of the people within the locality.
                        This makes the city an ideal place to settle and live in, given its richness in culture, 
                        assuring a high possibility for tighter community ties.</i></b></p>
